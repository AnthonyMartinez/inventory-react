# Concept: 
single page app that is mobile-first, can quickly track inventory numbers and output the final result in json- hopefully with the ability to copy and paste to clipboard

# Technology:
React and Next.js

#Roadmap/Progression (reflections indicated with //):
  1. Basic app // next is pretty cool! need a plug in for my linter though.
  2. Single page with all the headings and items // good practice on rendering arrays of components. Simple once you get the hang of it!
  3. Text input fields with simple buttons (simple!) // lots of debugging here: took some time here to learn more about JSX syntax
  4. 1 page per section with next and back, header, (nonfunctional submit button) // took a little while here to think of how the architecture of next.js implements routing and data flow. Had to look up a little bit about React Hooks. 
  5. Submit function w/ output
  6. (and beyond) deploying (to heroku?)
  7. styling
  8. Auto copy 
ui improvementskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
